Divebar Vintage is a bold script typeface steeped in retro spirit, channeling the charm of classic bar signage and hand-painted window lettering. Its curvy strokes and strong contrasts evoke a warm nostalgia, while maintaining a sense of lively confidence.

Designed with expressive swashes and upright rhythm, the font blends a sense of handcrafted personality with typographic precision. It carries the visual essence of neon-lit saloons, roadside diners, and vinyl-era record shopsâ€”full of character and charm without losing readability.

The font is built with advanced OpenType functionality and guaranteed top-notch quality, containing stylistic and contextual alternates, ligatures and more automatic and manual features; all to give you full control and customizability. 
It has extensive lingual support, covering all Latin-based languages, from North Europa to South Africa, from America to South-East Asia. It contains all characters and symbols you'll ever need, including all punctuation and numbers.
